- Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values

- When you assign a variable to a data type, the intepreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory

- python variables are NOT explicitly declared to reserve memory space; the declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to the variable
